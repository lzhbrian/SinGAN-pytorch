# SinGAN-Pytorch

pytorch reimplementation of [SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164)

still in progress.

### Train
```bash
python train.py
```

This will create a Tensorboard file in folder `ckpt/model_name/`
with learning curves, random samples, reconstructed samples every iteration.
